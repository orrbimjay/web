<p align="justify" class="style2">The company started its operation through the support and initiative given by friends and suppliers, where <strong>ORR</strong>-<strong>BIM</strong>-<strong>JAY</strong>â€™s name was derived from.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style2"><strong>ORRBIMJAY PHARMA</strong> was registered with the Department of Trade and Industry on August 6, 1986 and was issued a Certificate of Registration No. 86-23880. It is operating as a single proprietorship with Mr. Ronieldo David as Proprietor and General Manager. Its main office is located at <em>#16 Mt. Rainier St., Filinvest 1, Quezon City (1126), Philippines</em>.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style2">It was only in August 1987 that actual operations took place when the company imported its first packaging materials (rubber stoppers and aluminum seals) from Singapore on a 150-day term.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style2">Then in 1988, the company expanded its business. In addition to its regular importations from Singapore, the company imported European glass pharmaceutical vials. </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style2">A few years after, the company again included glass ampoules as one of its products.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style2">The company still imports rubber stoppers, aluminum seals, glass vials, glass ampoules and some syrup bottles from Europe and Asia.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style2">Because of the good business relationships the company had with reputable manufacturing laboratories, the company saw another business opportunity to tap. </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style2">The company engaged in the buy, sale and maintenance of laboratory equipments. This is still an on going business together with the pharmaceutical packaging business.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style2"> The company was given exclusive distributorship of selected Hizon Laboratories, Inc products. The company established another office at Davao to deal with the finished products business. </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style2">Throughout these years, the company has established good business relations with most of pharmaceutical and veterinary laboratories in the Philippines. Thus. ORRBIMJAY PHARMA is still expanding its business together with our Mechanical Engineer Artemio DV. Guillermo Jr. with his Industrial Services specializing in installation, repair and maintenance of commercial and industrial air conditioning units, motor rewinding and fabrication which will provide superior quality turn-key solutions through custom designs, manufacturing and support of plant-related systems.</p>
